      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>PillNet is an innovative mobile app that leverages a neural network to identify pills based on image input. The app allows users to take a picture of a pill, and within seconds, it provides a possible identification, including the pill's name, dosage, and manufacturer. This tool is especially beneficial for people with limited access to healthcare professionals and can help reduce medication errors.</p>

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>The app uses deep learning techniques to train a neural network model that recognizes pills from a large database of images. The model is optimized to handle different shapes, sizes, and colors of pills. The app integrates a simple, user-friendly interface that makes it easy for anyone to take a photo and receive instant identification results.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Accurate pill identification based on a photo, using a trained neural network model.</li>
        <li>Real-time feedback on pill identification results, including the name, dosage, and manufacturer.</li>
        <li>Integration with a large, continuously updated pill database.</li>
        <li>Accessibility features, including voice feedback and large text for those with visual impairments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep learning for image recognition, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</li>
        <li>Mobile app developed with React Native for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).</li>
        <li>Backend powered by Firebase to store pill data and user interactions.</li>
        <li>Cloud storage for storing high-quality images of pills used for training the neural network.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>PillNet aims to make pill identification quick and accessible to everyone, helping users identify their medication accurately and confidently. By integrating AI into healthcare applications, PillNet plays a critical role in empowering individuals to take control of their health while ensuring that they avoid potential medication errors.</p>
