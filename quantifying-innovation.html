      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project focused on the quantitative analysis of innovation in the medical technology sector through patent data. By leveraging patent databases, we aimed to measure the frequency of innovations and the strength of collaborations within the field.</p>

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>We applied data science techniques to identify trends in patent filings, analyzing the relationship between innovation and partnerships. By visualizing patent data, we discovered key factors that drive collaboration between companies and institutions.</p>

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Patent filings have significantly increased over the past decade, indicating a growing interest in medical innovations.</li>
        <li>Strong partnerships between universities and private sector companies are driving the most impactful innovations.</li>
        <li>Geographic distribution of patents highlights the concentration of innovation in specific regions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between innovation and partnerships in medical technologies. It underscores the importance of collaboration in driving progress and the need for further investment in research and development.</p>
