          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>My name is Ariadna Bazaga Pozas, but I go by Ari. I am a fourth-year student in an integrated Master of Engineering (MEng) programme at UCL, specialising in Biomedical Engineering. My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, engineering, and technology. I am passionate about using innovative solutions, such as data science, machine learning, and full-stack web development, to improve medical outcomes and healthcare systems.</p>

          <h2>My Path</h2>
          <p>Growing up, I was always intrigued by how technology could solve complex problems, especially in the medical field. This fascination led me to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering, where I combine my technical skills with a deep interest in healthcare. At UCL, I am learning how to integrate engineering concepts with medical research, and I aspire to create tools that enhance patient care and streamline medical processes.</p>

        <li>Data science and AI: Leveraging data and machine learning to improve medical decision-making and healthcare outcomes.</li>
        <li>Biomedical technologies: Innovating in medical devices, wearable technologies, and diagnostic tools.</li>
        <li>Healthtech: Exploring ways to apply emerging technologies to improve healthcare accessibility, efficiency, and patient experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Leadership and Extracurriculars</h2>
      <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage in leadership roles and extracurricular activities. I am currently serving as an Academic Cohort Representative at UCL, where I represent the student body and collaborate with faculty to improve the educational experience. I also hold the position of Event Manager at the UCL Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Society, where I help organize events such as networking socials, academic panels, and lab tours.</p>

      <h2>Goals and Vision</h2>
      <p>My long-term goal is to integrate my engineering and biomedical skills to develop healthcare solutions that directly impact patients' lives. I am particularly interested in how emerging technologies can bridge gaps in healthcare systems, providing better and more accessible care for all. I aim to combine my technical expertise with my leadership experiences to drive innovation in healthtech and biomedical engineering.</p>

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, from scuba diving to academic writing. I also speak multiple languages, including Spanish and English, and have received certifications in public speaking and communication. Volunteering is another important aspect of my life, and I enjoy contributing to community-based projects that aim to make a positive social impact.</p>
