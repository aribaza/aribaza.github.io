      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The T-flex system is a wearable technology designed specifically for beginner weightlifters. It helps prevent posture-related injuries by providing instant feedback when posture is suboptimal. By promoting proper form, T-flex encourages safer weightlifting habits and reduces the risk of long-term back issues.</p>

      <h2>Functionality and Design</h2>
      <p>The T-flex monitors back curvature using a flex sensor calibrated to the user's ideal posture. When posture deviates, the device alerts the user with red lights and resumes green lights once the posture is corrected. Key features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom calibration for individual back curvature.</li>
        <li>Real-time feedback via LED lights (red for poor posture, green for correct posture).</li>
        <li>Integration into a long-sleeved gym shirt for comfort and practicality.</li>
        <li>Lightweight design to avoid counterbalancing the lifted weight.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Testing and Placement</h2>
      <p>Testing revealed the lower back as the most effective sensor placement due to its high sensitivity to posture changes. The flex sensor accurately measures deviations, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 100% based on initial trials.</p>

      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adafruit Circuit Playground for programming and feedback control.</li>
        <li>Flex sensor for posture detection with a resistance range of 60K to 110K Ohms.</li>
        <li>3D-printed case for the circuit board, enhancing aesthetics and usability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <p>Planned improvements include transitioning to a wireless design and developing a companion smartphone app. The app will provide additional functionalities such as tracking posture metrics and alerting users to both inward and outward posture deviations.</p>
